# Google_Palm_LLM

This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a Q&A system for an e-learning company. They have thousands of learners who uses discord server or email to ask questions. This system will provide a streamlit based user interface for students where they can ask questions and get answers.
